# GoblinDungeon
A point&amp;click adventure game written for an MSc programming module. This module really refreshed and clarified my understanding of OOP principles; in particular, decoupling the logic from the user interface. Looking back, I was still in the habit of writing 'clever' but unnecessarily complicated code to show off, but I soon learned that its very counterproductive.

Something else I really enjoyed about this project was building the UI with Swing, and working with a more event driven style of programming.
